title: Troubleshooting

In case you're experiencing problems using vtk.js, here is a list of solutions to some frequently encountered issues. If this page doesn't help you solve your problem, try doing a search on [GitHub](https://github.com/kitware/vtk-js/issues) or our [Mailing list](http://www.paraview.org/mailman/listinfo/vtk).

## Can't find application

VTK.js is not an application in itself, but a library.
If you were expecting an application out of VTK.js you were probably looking for either [Visualizer](https://github.com/kitware/visualizer), [LightViz](https://github.com/kitware/light-viz) or [ArticViewer](https://github.com/kitware/arctic-viewer).
